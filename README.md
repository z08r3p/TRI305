●          if   you have or have had asthma or allergic disease   as   shortness   of   breath   may   occur
●          if   you suffer from hayfever, nasal polyps or chronic   obstructive respiratory   disorders   as   an   increased   risk of   allergic reactions exists. The allergic reactions may present as asthma attacks   (so-called analgesic asthma), Quincke’s oedema or urticaria
●          if   you have heart problems
●          if   you have a history of   gastrointestinal disease (such as ulcerative   colitis,   Crohn’s   disease)
●          if   you have systemic lupus   erythematosus or mixed connective   tissue   disease   (a   disease   affecting the   skin,   joints   and   kidneys)
●          if   you have certain hereditary blood formation disorders (e.g. acute   intermittent   porphyria)
●          if   you have a blood clotting   disorder
●          if   you are taking other NSAIDs. The use with concomitant   NSAIDs, including cyclo-oxygenase-2   specific inhibitors, increases the risk of   adverse reactions (see section “Other medicines   and
Ibuprofen” below) and should be avoided
●          if   you   have   chickenpox   (varicella) it   is   advisable   to   avoid   use   of   Ibuprofen
●          if   you   are   elderly.
Patients with kidney or liver problems should first consult a   doctor before taking   ibuprofen   tablets.Anti-inflammatory/pain-killer   medicines   like   ibuprofen   maybe   associated   with   a   small   increased   risk   of   heart attack (“myocardial infarction”) or stroke, particularly when used at high   doses.      Do   not   exceed   the   recommended   dose   or   duration   of   treatment   (see   section   3).
You   should   discuss   your   treatment   with   your   doctor   or   pharmacist   before   taking   ibuprofen   if   you:
●         have heart problems including heart failure,   angina (chest pain), or if   you have   had   a   heart   attack,
bypass surgery, peripheral artery disease (poor circulation in the   legs   or   feet   due to narrow   or
blocked arteries), or any kind of   stroke (including ‘mini-stroke’ or transient ischaemic   attack,   ‘TIA’)
●         have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, have a family history of   heart disease   or   stroke,   or if   you are   a   smoker.
Very   rare   reports   of   potentially   life-threatening   skin   rashes   (Stevens-Johnson   syndrome, toxic   epidermal
necrolysis) have   been   reported   with   the   use   of   ibuprofen. Patients   are   at   higher   risk   of   such   reactions   during the first month of   therapy. Stop taking Ibuprofen and talk to your   doctor   or pharmacist   if   you notice   a   skin    rash, mucosal   lesions, or   any   other   signs   of   allergic   reactions   (see   section   4).
Undesirable   effects   maybe   minimised   by   using   the   minimum   effective   dose   for   the   shortest   period   of   time.   The elderly are at increased risk of   side   effects.
In general the habitual use of   (several sorts of) analgesics   can   lead to   lasting   severe kidney problems.   This         risk   maybe   increased   under   physical   strain   associated   with   loss   of   salt   and   dehydration. Therefore   it   should be avoided. There is a risk of   renal impairment in dehydrated   children   and   adolescents.
Prolonged   use   of   any   type   of   painkiller   for   headaches   can   make   them   worse. If   this   situation   is   experienced or suspected, medical advice should be obtained and treatment   should be discontinued.   The   diagnosis   of
medication   overuse   headache   (MOH) should   be   suspected   inpatients   who   have   frequent   or   daily   headaches despite   (or   because   of) the   regular   use   of   headache   medications.
NSAIDs   may   mask   symptoms   of   infection   and   fever.
In   prolonged   administration   of   Ibuprofen   regular   checking   of   your   liver   values, the   kidney   function, as   well as the blood count, is required. Your doctor may ask you to have blood tests during treatment.
